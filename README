What exactly is botifex?

Botifex is a communication bot currently working only with IRC. The main aspect
of the development was to provide a communication bot without any language
dependencies. This is a very complex task, so I hardcoded the seperation of words
and sentences. But that is the only restriction of language independency.
Botifex has no purpose than having fun with the sometimes funny stuff it writes.
It learns everything by itself and combines the known words to new sentences. Botifex
tries to say something appropriate to the current context. But i couldn't observe
that behaviour in tests, perhaps the knowledge was to small or the weight for the
context relations is too small.
The bot is also able to receive commands and so on, see "COMMANDS".

COMMANDS
Commands can be placed through the normal IRC or through the standard input. To
use commands with a higher rightlevel you have to authenticate yourself. All
commands over the standard input are treated like authenticated ones. The rights
needed to use a command can be changed via the perm command.
Commands that depend on a irc-server, are using the same server the IRC command
is send from, or the last server the bot connected to otherwise.
A list of all commands:

    !leave <CHANNEL>         The bot leaves the specified channel.
    !join <CHANNEL>          The bot joins the specified channel.
    !connect <SERVER>:<PORT> Connect to the server.
    !disconnect              Disconnects from the server.
    !save <FILE>             Saves the knowledge to the specified file.
    !load <FILE>             Loads the knowledge from a file, multiple loads are possible.
    !reset                   Resets the knowledge
    !learn <ENABLE>          This enables (1) or disables (0) the learning 
    !talky <LEVEL>           How chatty should the bot be (between 0 and 100)
    !auth <PASSWORD>         Authenticate yourself
    !deauth                  Logout
    !passwd <NEWPASSWORD>    Set the password for the bot
    !perm <CMD> <ACCESSLVL>  Sets the access level of the command CMD
    !nick <NICK>             Set the nick of the bot
    !autosave <FILE>         Periodically save the knowledge to the file.


To use the bot some commands have to be used. For example !nick and !connect.

HOW TO USE

First write all your normal commands into a file. Then you can cat the file and
pipe it to the binary:
    cat <STANDARD_COMMANDS> | ./botifex

Of course you can also type your commands on the console.
